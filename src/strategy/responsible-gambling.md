## Keeping Gambling Under Control

### The Golden Rules

**1. Only gamble what you can afford to lose**
This isn't just advice - it's the foundation of safe gambling. If losing the money would affect your rent, bills, food, or family, don't gamble it.

**2. Never chase losses**
The urge to "win it back" is powerful but dangerous. Losses are part of gambling. Accept them and move on.

**3. Set limits before you play**
Decide how much time and money you'll spend BEFORE starting. Write it down. Stick to it absolutely.

**4. Don't gamble when emotional**
Feeling stressed, angry, depressed, or even extremely happy? Not the time to gamble. Emotions impair judgment.

**5. Take regular breaks**
Step away frequently. Get a drink, stretch, do something else. Extended sessions lead to poor decisions.

### Healthy Gambling Habits

**Before each session:**
- Check your budget
- Set a time limit
- Decide your loss limit
- Ask: "Why am I playing today?"

**During play:**
- Take a break every 30-60 minutes
- Keep track of time and money spent
- Stop when you reach your limit
- Never borrow money to continue

**After playing:**
- Reflect on the session
- Did you stick to limits?
- How do you feel?
- Any concerning patterns?

## Recognising Warning Signs

### Early Warning Signs

These suggest gambling may be becoming problematic:

- Spending more time gambling than intended
- Thinking about gambling when doing other things
- Betting more than planned to get the same excitement
- Feeling restless when trying to stop
- Using gambling to escape problems or relieve negative feelings
- Returning to "get even" after losing

### Serious Warning Signs

These indicate gambling has become a problem:

- Lying to family about gambling
- Borrowing money or selling things to gamble
- Neglecting work, family, or responsibilities
- Feeling anxious, guilty, or depressed about gambling
- Arguments with loved ones about gambling
- Gambling with money meant for bills or essentials

### The Self-Assessment

Answer honestly:

1. Have you ever felt you needed to gamble more to get the same excitement?
2. Have you ever lied to people important to you about gambling?
3. Have you ever felt restless or irritable when trying to stop?
4. Have you ever gambled to escape problems or relieve bad feelings?
5. Have you ever returned another day to try to win back losses?
6. Have you ever risked or lost relationships because of gambling?

If you answered "yes" to any of these, consider seeking support.

## Using Casino Safety Tools

### Deposit Limits

Set maximum amounts you can deposit:
- Daily limits
- Weekly limits
- Monthly limits

Once set, increases typically have a 24-72 hour cooling-off period.

**Recommendation:** Set these lower than you think you need.

### Loss Limits

Cap how much you can lose:
- Automatically prevents further play when reached
- Resets at your chosen interval
- Provides a safety net

### Session Time Limits

Control how long you play:
- Set maximum session length
- Receive reminders at intervals
- Auto-logout when time expires

**Recommendation:** Start with 30-minute reminders.

### Reality Checks

Pop-up reminders showing:
- How long you've been playing
- How much you've won or lost
- Option to continue or stop

These break the trance of continuous play.

### Self-Exclusion

Temporarily or permanently block yourself:
- **Cooling off:** 24 hours to 6 weeks
- **Self-exclusion:** 6 months to 5 years
- **GAMSTOP:** UK-wide exclusion from all licensed sites

Self-exclusion is reversible (after minimum period), but the process is deliberately slow.

### Using Tools Isn't Weakness

Using these tools shows:
- Self-awareness
- Maturity
- Responsibility
- Good decision-making

The smartest gamblers use every tool available.
