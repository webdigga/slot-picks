## Types of Welcome Bonuses

### Deposit Match Bonuses

The most common type. The casino matches a percentage of your deposit:

**Example: "100% up to £100"**
- Deposit £100
- Receive £100 bonus
- Total playing funds: £200

**Variations:**
- **50% match** - Deposit £100, get £50 bonus
- **200% match** - Deposit £100, get £200 bonus (total £300)
- **Tiered matches** - Different percentages on multiple deposits

### Free Spins

Spins on selected slots at no cost to you:

**Types:**
- **Deposit free spins** - Credited after depositing
- **No deposit free spins** - Given just for registering
- **Wager-free free spins** - Winnings paid as real cash

**Important:** Free spin value varies (usually £0.10-£0.20 per spin)

### No Deposit Bonuses

Small bonuses given without requiring a deposit:
- Typically £5-£20 in bonus funds
- Or 10-50 free spins
- High wagering requirements
- Low maximum win caps

### Cashback Offers

A percentage of losses returned:
- Example: "10% cashback up to £50"
- If you lose £100, receive £10 back
- Some have no wagering on the cashback
- Often ongoing, not just welcome offers

## Understanding Wagering Requirements

### What Are Wagering Requirements?

Wagering requirements (or playthrough requirements) specify how many times you must wager your bonus before withdrawing winnings.

**Example: 35x wagering on a £100 bonus**
- You must wager: £100 × 35 = £3,500
- Only then can you withdraw bonus winnings

### Calculating True Cost

| Bonus | Wagering | Must Wager | Expected Loss (4% edge) |
|-------|----------|------------|------------------------|
| £100 | 20x | £2,000 | £80 |
| £100 | 35x | £3,500 | £140 |
| £100 | 50x | £5,000 | £200 |
| £100 | 70x | £7,000 | £280 |

At 70x wagering, you're mathematically expected to lose more than the bonus is worth.

### Wagering Rating Scale

| Wagering | Rating | Assessment |
|----------|--------|------------|
| 0x | Excellent | No wagering - best possible |
| 1-20x | Very Good | Fair terms, achievable |
| 21-35x | Good | Standard, reasonable |
| 36-50x | Average | Challenging but possible |
| 51-70x | Poor | Difficult to profit from |
| 70x+ | Very Poor | Avoid unless desperate |

### Bonus + Deposit vs Bonus Only

**"35x wagering on bonus only"**
- £100 deposit + £100 bonus
- Wager £100 × 35 = £3,500

**"35x wagering on bonus + deposit"**
- £100 deposit + £100 bonus
- Wager £200 × 35 = £7,000

Always check which applies - it makes a massive difference.

## Game Contributions

### What Is Game Contribution?

Not all games count equally toward wagering. Casinos limit high-RTP or low-volatility games:

**Typical Contributions:**
| Game Type | Contribution | £100 bet counts as |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| Slots | 100% | £100 |
| Scratch Cards | 100% | £100 |
| Instant Win | 100% | £100 |
| Table Games | 10-20% | £10-20 |
| Video Poker | 10% | £10 |
| Live Casino | 0-10% | £0-10 |
| Blackjack | 0-10% | £0-10 |
| Roulette | 0-20% | £0-20 |

### Excluded Games

Some games don't count at all:
- Usually specified in terms
- Often includes certain slots (Blood Suckers, Mega Joker)
- Playing excluded games may void your bonus

### Best Games for Wagering

**Ideal characteristics:**
- 100% contribution
- Low volatility (more spins from your bankroll)
- Reasonable RTP (96%+)
- Not excluded

**Good choices:**
- Starburst
- Aloha! Cluster Pays
- Thunderstruck II
- Most standard slots

## Strategies for Bonus Play

### Before Claiming

1. **Read all terms** - Know wagering, contributions, excluded games
2. **Calculate the value** - Use the formula above
3. **Check withdrawal limits** - Some bonuses cap max withdrawal
4. **Note the time limit** - Bonuses expire (often 7-30 days)

### During Play

1. **Play 100% contribution games only**
2. **Choose low-to-medium volatility** - Extend your playtime
3. **Use smaller stakes** - More spins, more wagering covered
4. **Track your progress** - Most casinos show remaining requirements

### Stake Sizing

**Formula:** Bonus Amount ÷ Required Wager × 500

Example: £100 bonus, 35x wagering
- Must wager: £3,500
- Ideal stake: £3,500 ÷ 500 = £0.70 per spin

This gives roughly 500 spins of coverage - enough for variance to smooth out.

### When to Claim

**Claim if:**
- Wagering is 35x or below
- Time limit is 30+ days
- Max withdrawal isn't severely limited
- You were planning to deposit anyway

**Skip if:**
- Wagering exceeds 50x
- Tight time constraints
- Heavy restrictions on games you enjoy
- You don't like playing with restrictions

## Red Flags to Avoid

### Warning Signs

**Extremely high wagering (70x+)**
These bonuses are designed to be nearly impossible to profit from.

**Very short time limits (3-7 days)**
Rushing increases mistakes and poor decisions.

**Low maximum win caps**
"Win up to £100 maximum" on a £100 bonus is poor value.

**Unclear or hidden terms**
If terms are hard to find, the casino may not want you to find them.

**Bonus "stickiness"**
Sticky bonuses mean the bonus itself can never be withdrawn - only winnings. Check if yours is sticky.

### Questions to Ask

1. Is wagering on bonus only or bonus + deposit?
2. What games contribute 100%?
3. What's the time limit?
4. Is there a max withdrawal from bonus funds?
5. What's the max bet while bonus is active?

### The Max Bet Rule

Most bonuses have maximum bet limits while active (often £5):
- Betting above this can void your bonus
- No warning - you just lose everything
- Always check and respect this limit

## Making the Right Choice

### When Bonuses Make Sense

- You're depositing anyway
- Terms are fair (35x or less)
- You enjoy playing slots
- You have time to complete wagering
- The value proposition is positive

### When to Skip Bonuses

- You prefer table games (poor contribution)
- You have limited time
- Terms are restrictive
- You dislike playing under restrictions
- You'd rather just play with your own money

### No-Wagering Alternatives

Some casinos offer no-wagering bonuses:
- Winnings are real cash immediately
- No playthrough requirements
- Usually smaller bonuses
- But 100% of value is accessible

These are objectively better when available.

## Final Thoughts

Welcome bonuses can provide genuine value, but only if you understand what you're getting into. The best approach is:

1. Always read full terms
2. Calculate the expected value
3. Only claim if terms are reasonable
4. Play optimally for wagering
5. Don't chase bonus completion at any cost

Remember: a bonus that seems too good to be true usually is. Fair casinos offer fair terms. If something looks exploitative, it probably is.
