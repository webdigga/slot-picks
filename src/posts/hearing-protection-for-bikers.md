**Why do I need Auritech motorcycle hearing protection?**

Wind noise on a motorbike can reach levels of up to 105dB, while motorsport spectators may experience levels of up to 130dB. Considering that permanent hearing damage can occur from exposure to just 85dB, it is crucial for motorbike riders to always use specialist earplugs for protection.
