title: Hearing Protection For Workers
description: Factory and work machinery can generate noise levels of up to
  120dB, posing a significant risk to your hearing health. Considering that
  permanent hearing damage can occur from exposure to just 85dB, it is
  imperative to prioritize the use of hearing protection at all times in these
  environments.
