*I have always been keen to play with craft material from a very young age. From my grandmother teaching me to make embroidered frames to my mother letting me use her Singer sewing machine, I started by making clothes for my dolls, made summer dresses for myself and my friends asked her to shorten a dress or mend a jumper.*

## Kinaesthetic Learner

*I am a kinaesthetic learner. I need to feel the material and look at all the different options the material offers. When I have a clear vision of what it could become, after my thoughts have travelled, the design evolves until it materialises.*

*I know that Merino, silk and wool behave differently. Each has its own characteristic which has an impact on the blending of colours, patterns and texture. There is so much to explore. There are no limits to weaving. One of my teachers said that there are no rules in weaving but discipline, patience and resilience. I would add that once I have understood the pattern and how the yarn behave, the process of weaving become a meditation.*

*After seeing Anni Albers exhibition at Tate Modern I became obsessed with weaving. I bought a tiny beginner frame loom and enjoyed hours or mixing colours and texture. I was encouraged with a gift of a Rigid Heddle Loom and later on I was given an eight shafts loom.*

*Learning to weave is an amazing source of expression. When I acquired an 8 shafts loom, I looked at it in awe, wondering if I could ever master the technique. Fortunately, my Weaving teacher was and still is an inspiration. She can always find a solution to the complications I create in my weaving. Weaving has limitless potential, is endlessly fascinating and the sight of beautiful cloth mindfully growing before my eyes is a source of great joy and satisfaction. I find weaving magical, knitting therapeutic, sewing exciting, crocheting calming.*

## Ritualistic rhythm of weaving

*My inspiration comes from a variety of sources: travels, textures and patterns found in landscape and architecture. When I hols a piece of material or yarn, I imagine the different ways to make it alive, and I love seeing the patterns develop until the finished project is off the loom or the sewing machine. I always feel very grateful to be able to express myself in this way and enjoy the meditative and ritualistic rhythm of weaving.*

*Every piece is unique. Not per choice but I don't seem to be able to repeat the same thing twice. I enjoy superimposing different texture of material to give more structure to a piece. After many trials and errors, which is the only way to grow, my aim is to continue to learn and improve my skills to follow my imagination and transform my mundane everyday life into more exciting experiences.*

## The possibilities to express my thoughts

*I experiment with every kind of material and textures. The result can be fair or amazing. It is not machine Perfect, it is hand and heart made. The possibilities to express my thoughts and feelings are endless and I always aspire to discover where my next ideas will take me. I make scarves, cushions, table runners, embroidered frames, which I call “ornamentals” and I made my first poncho on a rigid heddle loom. I love the hand dyed Merino wool from Laughing Hens.*

*The summer scarves are made from Linen, bamboo yarn and mercerised cotton. The winter scarves are made from thick yarn and Alpaca wool.*

## Seamless shopping experience

*My vision is a seamless shopping experience, making items to bring comfort, pleasure, smile to people while creating and practicing my own mindfulness therapy, allowing me to create even more beautifully crafted pieces.*

*I live in Greater London, which gives me the opportunity to get to the many museums and exhibitions held in this vibrant capital. Sometimes I amaze myself and sometimes I look for my shuttle while I am holding it. I hope you enjoy my craft as much as I enjoy making it.*

*Am*
